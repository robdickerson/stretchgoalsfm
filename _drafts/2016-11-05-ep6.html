<h3>Transcript</h3>

<p><b>Robert</b>: In this episode, Scott and I will be talking about how to position and grow your business when competing with the corporate giants of your industry. This is the Stretch Goals Podcast where each week, we'll share insights and lessons learned based on our experiences as entrepreneurs. We challenge you to create ambitious goals as you start and grow your business. I'm your host, Robert Dickerson. Your competitors have been working on the problem you're trying to solve for years. They have large teams. They have raised millions of dollars. How do you compete with these industry giants? That's going to be the focus of our episode today.</p>

<p>Scott, I wanted to talk about in this episode, each of us starting our companies and how we've competed with large established players. With Mapout, we're developing essentially a learning management system. There are a ton of competitors out there. This is a pretty large space. Everyday I read about competitors of ours that have raised tens of millions of dollars and they have large teams. Sometimes, it can be really tough to focus on the problems that I am trying to solve when I see all these people raising all this money and they have these huge teams.</p>

<p>I'm really running with a pretty lean small team. I thought it would be good today to talk about the challenges that we face in growing our business because basically, I think of them, and I think you said too is there are opportunities that you have that maybe some of those bigger players don't.</p>

<p>I think one of the first things, for me at least at Mapout, is I've really started out by creating a company that has a value add. What is the niche that I'm trying to carve out and scale? What is the customer base that I'm really focusing on? For Mapout, I really started to focus on mobile and the mobile apps. The reason for that is the existing learning management systems don't really have a strong focus in the mobile space. If you think about how you learn, the devices that people are carrying everyday. They're carrying their phones, they're carrying their tablets.</p>

<p>The value add of Mapout is that we can deliver video training directly to their phone so people can watch it. They can take it with them. They can have the videos offline. Our focus and how we compete with these large companies is that we really focus on a mobile approach and doing that really well. That's able to differentiate ourselves. Talk a little bit about Mob-X I know with Critical Technologies, you were doing some minor league baseball apps. How did you differentiate those companies from your competitors?</p>

<p><b>Scott</b>: When I was with Critical Technologies Group, which was a company that I founded, looking back at some of our previous podcasts, it very much started as a side project and grew. Skip in forward into the future a little bit, I realized that there was opportunities and things that I was passionate about, which specifically is sports and more specifically was baseball. I looked at it and I was like, "These teams, they don't have an app."</p>

<p>Major league baseball has an app but these individual minor league teams don't have an app. Minor league baseball was trying to put together some website where you could come in and you could view statistics and videos and scores and schedules. It wasn't specific to all these individual teams. The individual teams, they live and die of off these promotions and things that get fans in stadium because they're not a large entity. In a lot of cases, some of these stadiums have less than 3,000 seats. The other ones are larger because they're in a bigger market. There is a wide array.</p>

<p>I knew that as someone who was passionate about the sport. I just said, "You know what? I'm just going to go to these guys, cold call them. Show up at their door and tell them what I can do for them." That worked for me. What was great about it is there were some larger companies that were trying to do things but they were creating these complex solutions that really didn't target what minor league baseball needed, what these smaller sports establishments needed. Keep in mind, when I say small, I mean, they're still bringing in millions of fans a year so they're still rather large but they have very specific needs. They very much run like a small business.</p>

<p>I just basically said, "This is an opportunity for me. I can be more flexible than these larger competitors." I went in and I did that. I did it well. I did everything that I wanted. I met all of their needs. I ended up having market share within a year. I had more than 50% of minor league baseball running my apps with 10 million fans using it everyday. I just went full speed ahead. I steam rolled. For me, there was big competition which was major league baseball and minor league baseball as a whole and some bigger competitors.</p>

<p>I didn't really look at them as competition. I looked at them as people who were stagnant and didn't have a good vision. One question I had for you, was mobile your idea from inception? Was that your key differentiator? Was that a part of your business plan from the get-go? That was to target and compete with these other competitors or did that just come organically? Were you building this product and then you were like, "Man, you know what's going to make me stand out? It's mobile." How did that come about for you?</p>

<p><b>Robert</b>: I think it was organically because I started out doing a lot of research around the existing systems that were out there and trying to think about, "How do I stand out from the existing competition and what's out there?" A lot of learning management systems have responsive web pages and things like that but they didn't have a native mobile app. I thought about, "Well, with a native mobile app, you can do things beyond the web page," like download the videos. You can provide a more seamless experience, people can go download the app from the app store so that's another marketing channel.</p>

<p>It grew from there and talking to customers and figuring out, "Well, what do you really need in terms of delivering this content?" If you think about millennials and some of the new generation coming into the workforce, they're more used to using their phone to do a lot of things. Having training behind a VPN that you have to log into and making it really difficult to access, those are barriers for people that actually never use that training.</p>

<p>Companies are focusing a lot of money into growing these huge training courses that no one uses because they're unable to access it. That was really my focus. With Mapout, I was trying to add that value add in mobile and then going out to companies and pitching them on why they should take their existing courses into the mobile realm. I really try to focus on, I guess maybe a revolutionary approach as opposed to incremental approach. How do I take learning to the next level? How do I weave into the culture of the company more in a revolutionary way as opposed to trying to match feature for feature with existing systems.</p>

<p>Because if I try to go feature by feature, I'm never going to get there because they have larger teams. They've been doing this for years. I have to figure out a way to position myself where I'm not directly competing with them, where someone can look at my features and look at their features and say, "Well, you don't have X, Y, and Z, so I'm just going to go with this guy over here."</p>
