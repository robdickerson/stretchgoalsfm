    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: In this episode of the Stretch Goals podcast Scott and I are going to be talking about recruiters and are they worth your time. This is a Stretch Goals podcast. Where each week we’ll share insights and lessons learned based on our experiences on entrepreneurs. We’ll challenge you to create ambitious goals as you start and grow your business. I’m your host, Robert Dickerson.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  And I’m Scott Davis.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: So Scott, this week I wanted to talk about recruiters.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Oy vey.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: Yeah, this will be a fun topic, especially on LinkedIn, because they’ve taken over LinkedIn. I get a lot of messages from recruiters. I wanted to dive into … First of all to help recruiters out, how should you approach people, we’ll both engineers, so maybe we’ll be a little bit more focused on engineers and how you get their attention. Especially if someone has a full-time job, how do you approach them with an opportunity and get their interest?</p>
    <p>The second thing I wanted to talk about is, is it worth your time as an individual looking for a job, and then … I guess the third phase is as a business owner, how you could use and leverage recruiters and is it an efficient way to bring on employees? I’ve been getting emails on LinkedIn and messages on LinkedIn and one message in particular I got, they said, “Oh, we have this great opportunity, we see you’re an entrepreneur, would you be interested?” But the didn’t say anything about he opportunity. I mean, what is it? It’s like, sales 101, it’s like, don’t reach out to someone with some nebulous thing. It’s like, let’s talk about something that you’re not gonna tell me anything about.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah, but I think that’s their tactic, I think is to get you to engage them and ask for more info so that they can find out if you’re A, in the market, B, open to an opportunity, or C, even like really there. That’s their tactic, right? It’s like they’re trying to get you to respond. I got to be honest, and I’m sure you’re the same way, if I had a dollar for every recruiter email I got every week, I wouldn’t need to work anymore. It’s just ridiculous. I actually have spam filters setup. If it even looks or smells like a recruiter email, it goes straight to spam. The reason for that is, most of the opportunities have nothing to do with what I really care about.</p>
    <p>If you’re a recruiter listening to this, know the people that you’re talking to and target what you’re presenting to them personally. A lot of times for example, I’ll see, senior IOS engineer in some small town in Alaska. Yeah. Guess what? Not moving to Alaska, number one. Beautiful. Beautiful state, but not moving there. Look where I’m located currently. Just little things like that. A lot of times it’s people who don’t … I mean, it’s just a prefab email that you can tell that they’ve blasted off. I don’t want any interest in that.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: I think doing your research is really important, because that comes down to any kind of sales, is you need to research what’s a person working on, what are their interests? Don’t pitch an entry level job to a senior person, you know what I mean? You have to figure out even if the skill set, and that’s a lot of times I’ll talk to recruiters and they just don’t have any idea about the skills needed or anything about the job and it’s just way off from the type of work that I’m even doing.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  They’re just keyword matching. They’re taking your resume, they look for these little keywords, and they go, oh, Scott has <a href="http://asp.net">asp.net</a> experience. Yeah, I had that 10 years ago. I haven’t touched it since then, so stop calling me about it. It’s keyword matching. That’s all it is. They’re just … They’ve got your net resume, they sucked it off of DICE and Monster and LinkedIn, and now they’ve got it in a database and anytime they get a hit on it, they fire off all these things. It’s annoying because there’s no real context to it. What I like, in the recruiters that I do talk to, and I do talk to them, they get to know me first.</p>
    <p>So like, hey, listen, I’m a recruiter, I’m here, here’s types of jobs I find. I see your experience. What types of things are you interested in, or are you even interested at all? Are you looking for remote opportunities, blah, blah, blah, blah. The ones that actually try to get to know you, instead of just firing off a position and hoping you respond, those are the ones that I talk to. A lot of times, they’ll be like, hey look, I’ve been trying to fill this position for three months and I can’t find anybody, do you know anybody who can fit it? I’ll absolutely send people over to them. Again, it’s a personal thing. If you get to know me and I get to know you, I can trust you and I’ll help you out, but don’t fire off blank emails without knowing me or anything about me.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: Yeah. Like you said, you’re establishing that trust and you’re really trying to understand what the person is trying to do, as opposed to just trying to match up some keyword to the position, because that doesn’t help anyone, right? It doesn’t help the person that’s looking for a job, it doesn’t help the employer that they’re just getting all these resumes of people who aren’t really qualified and fit for the job. You really need to spend time and learn about what positions take, what people are people interested in and really try to match these things up.</p>
    <p>I think that recruiters will have a better time if you do that. The other thing I’ve seen is that recruiters will post on LinkedIn that they’ve talked to someone and the person, you know, they’ll cold call someone and the person’s not very nice to them, so they’ll post their whole conversation on LinkedIn. I mean, that’s ridiculous. I mean, really? You’re gonna cold call someone and then they don’t have time for you? That’s just not the right way to go. You need to establish some sort of relationship with that person first. Just cold calling someone and expecting them just to start having a conversation with you is just unrealistic in my mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Absolutely. I gotta say, I don’t have any animosity towards recruiters. It’s a growing industry. Their salaries are increasing and they need to find people and that’s what they do, they’re good at it, at least most of them are. Some of my best friends in the software industry are recruiters. I’ve established relationships with them over the years through them placing me places and going to baseball games with them and things like that. I’ve got some great relationships with recruiters.</p>
    <p>In fact, in our last episode when we were talking about how to sell your business, one of the key people that I talked to when I was selling my business, was someone who ran a recruiting agency, because I trusted him and his perspective on the industry and his knowledge. Recruiters, you know, if they’re doing their job right, they know what’s hot in the industry, they know what companies are doing what technologies, and they’re really good at that sense of having their finger on the pulse. If you’re looking for a job, they’re often times the greatest people to go to, because they can find you exactly what they want, but again, they can only do that if they get to know you and you get to know them.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: I think using a recruiter is not the only way. If you’re looking for a position, using a recruiter should complement what you’re already doing, which is networking with people, reaching out to companies. Don’t just go on a job site and just expect to submit your resume and someone to respond. Try to find people within the company, that are already working there, that maybe you know or you have connections with that you can approach directly.</p>
    <p>That’s a much better way to send your resume. That person already in the company and help them get you that meeting. Don’t rely just on recruiters, don’t rely just on submitting your resume to some HR website. If you really wanna get a job, you need to be really proactive and go out there and do everything you can to get that opportunity, because otherwise, you’re just gonna be waiting around. While recruiters can do a good job of matching, don’t just let that be the only way if you’re actually searching.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Sure, and those are good points. I think that there’s a distinction between the different types of recruiters that are out there. There could be a recruiter who recruits specifically for a company, so let’s say Coca Cola or something. All they do is, they work for Coca Cola, they’re looking to find people to fill positions at Coca Cola. They know Coca Cola and the environment. Those are good people to get to know, but again, they’re only looking for people for a specific company. Then there’s recruiters who go out and they work for a recruiting agency and they try to hire for many, many different companies and positions that are available.</p>
    <p>I think those are the ones that get the bad rap, because a lot of them are just doing the keyword matching in their database, like I said, and the skillset matching. They aren’t necessarily trying to connect with people. I know there’s people listening on LinkedIn to this who are recruiters that I know very well. I’m not talking about you. If you’re on my LinkedIn list, I actually like you. There’s people out there, they just don’t know, they just blast things. It’s like the car salesman who’s like, hey folks, what are you looking for? And just starts his pitch. That doesn’t work.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: What about if you’re not looking for a job? A lot of these positions, they require a lot of experience in certain areas, so, really, to hire good people, you have to go to people that are already employed, so those people aren’t really looking for a job, right? I think that part makes it even harder for the recruiter, is they have to entice that person to say, okay, I’ll even entertain the idea of talking to you about this job.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah. And again, that’s where it comes back to, get to know the person. If you say, hey, listen, are you free for lunch or are you free for a 15 minute phone call, I’m a recruiter, I’m just trying to get a sense for what you’re looking for in your career or if you’re even looking for an opportunity. If they approach me that way, I’ll talk to them. It’s just when you get the specific title for a specific position that they don’t know anything about you, then I just delete it or it goes to spam.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: Yeah, so all recruiters, this is Scott Davis, you can find … You’re gonna get a ton of email.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Well, you know for a while I started sending all emails back to them. I had a rule that if you sent me a position that was a spam position, it would forward it to the other people who sent me spam messages from the same day. It was basically sending 200 emails a day, then I started getting a lot of negative feedback on that, so I turned it off.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: I think you’re right. It’s making those connections and from a recruiters side, if you can make those connections with people, even if they’re not looking for a job and provide them some sort of value. A lot of times, I know people that will ask me about, do they know any places that they can get jobs or I’ll have their resume. I know you sent me some peoples resume when I’m looking for positions to hire.</p>
    <p>There’s this art, this internal network of people that are … especially business owners that are communicating, because we’re constantly looking for good people. There might be a lot of times, not even an opening. A lot of times I won’t create an opening and if I find someone that’s really good, I’ll kinda fit him or figure out a way that I can bring him on. A lot of times there’s not necessarily even an opening if you find the right person. That’s why networking’s so powerful.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah. I agree. Networking is very important. Like I said, it’s all about those relationships. In the past, when I used to work in the corporate world, if somebody called me up and said, hey, is this company hiring right now? What’s going on? That’s fine, but if you do that every month, if you call me every month, that’s borderline annoying. Again, it’s just had a natural once a quarter, reach out and just catch up. A 10 minute phone call, five minute phone call or grab a cup of coffee or something.</p>
    <p>We’ve talked about this in previous episodes, like connecting with people and how to communicate and social networking. It’s just a natural thing. If you do that, you’re gonna be more successful, because then, when I do know of a position that’s being hired, I’m gonna go, oh, you know what, that guy who’s extremely nice at recruiter company X, he’s asked about this before, let me send this his way. Those are the types of relationships and things that you want, those organic experiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: What about from a business side? The business value to bring on recruiters? I think there is a lot of value there, especially if your company’s growing and you’re looking for specific positions where maybe there’s not a lot of individuals that are out there. You’re not getting a lot of resumes or maybe you don’t even have the time as a small business owner.</p>
    <p>I think that’s where recruiters can be really powerful. If you find the right people to work with you, but you really need to make sure that they understand your business, they understand the type of people and the roles that you’re trying to hire for. And make sure that they place people in those positions and they really understand what you’re looking for.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah. I agree. It’s all about knowing your customer and knowing the company. In the past, I’ve had some good relationships with recruiters who, they knew what I was looking for and they knew what the company was looking for. They came to me and said, look, I feel like this is a good fit. It’s kinda like finding a good real estate agent who knows what you want and find that perfect house for you. It’s the same type of thing. As a business or as somebody who’s looking for a job, having that understanding of what the environment is and the understanding of what the person wants, is extremely beneficial.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: Do you feel like that saved you time by spending some time on the front end kinda communicate your vision and who you needed?</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah. A lot of times I was very specific. Yeah. It was like, hey, I will not work in an environment like X, but I wanna work on cutting edge things or I wanna work on a team that’s like this. It saved me a lot of time, because I knew that if I was gonna take time off from work to go for an interview, that it wasn’t going to be a waste of my time. In the early days, I didn’t know that and I was wasting a lot of time going to interviews that were completely pointless.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: That should be another episode. Maybe next week we can talk about interviewing. You, as someone looking for a job, you wanna make sure that you’re not wasting your time going to positions. We’ve probably all have heard horror stories of people, you know, I’ve heard horror stories of the job position not even being available and they have company interviewing people. That’s just wasting everybody’s time there.</p>
    <p>I think from the business side, as a small business, your time is really valuable. You don’t have a lot of time to spend recruiting people that aren’t the right fit for your company. As much time as you can save there by leveraging other people such as recruiters to help you there, I think that’s very beneficial.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah. I think that if you’re a company and you got a recruiter that’s done a good job for you, you instantly come up with this sort of organic relationship where you go back to them for all your hiring needs in the future. That’s usually how it works and I’ve seen it be very successful in the corporate world with a team of recruiters that a company can trust and then that’s their bond for the next 10 years for hiring people. Again, it all comes down relationships. If you’re just firing off these emails for these positions to people that you don’t even know, you might get a one percent take rate, but you’re gonna get a 10% take rate if you establish a relationship with them.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: Yeah, but are those the right people that you really want anyway? You know what I mean?</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Yeah.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: It’s like, even if someone does respond, are they the right person? You don’t really know by just sending out emails to everybody.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Absolutely. Yeah. You’re just throwing darts.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: Yeah. It really goes back to sales. As in anything, you need to establish a relationship. Hopefully this was helpful.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Stop sending me emails.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert</strong>: If you’re interested in finding a new job, try to find the right recruiter and recruiters. Spend a little bit of time to research the people that you’re reaching out to and try to figure out a way that you can provide value to those people. I guarantee that you’ll get a better response rate from that.</p>
    <p><strong>Scott</strong>:  Absolutely. Recruiters, I know you’re listening to this. Give us your feedback. We wanna hear what you have to say and we want to hear how the industry’s changing, so leave us comment on SoundCloud, iTunes, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>
